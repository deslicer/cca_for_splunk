    CCA for Splunk's user interface is a helper function that assists in creating and execute the
    ansible-playbook commands for a give playbook and host selection. It gives full control
    to see and select target hosts. Each ansible playbook has a set of configurable arguments,
    on the page with extra vars, additional variables are listed with their default values.

    You will be guided through playbook selection, host limits and options to configure the
    additional variables.

    Release notes:

    2024.1.1
              - Important:
                  * If you are running on Linux Kernel 5.8 or later, execute the 'configure_linux_server.yml'
                    playbook on all Splunk servers to install and configure the included
                    'cca_cgroup_version_daemon'. This is a systemd service that takes care of re-enabling
                    support for cgroup v1. In the event that the Kernel is updated to a version requiring
                    the switch to cgroup v2, 'the Splunkd.service' may fail to start after a reboot.
                  * For the initial installation of Splunk using CCA, there are no additional steps to
                    be performed.
              - Bumped Splunk Enterprise version to 9.1.3, Splunk 9.1 track is recommended for production
                usage.
              - Added script to ease download of supported Splunk Enterprise versions.
                ${CCA_REPO_DIR}/roles/cca.splunk.enterprise-install/files/bin/download_splunk_enterprise.sh

              - Updated conditions that rely on ansible groups so inventory can be made smaller and
                unused groups can be removed from the inventory.
              - Improved handling of cluster bundle validation errors. Fail task only on critical
                errors.
              - Changed static retries for splunk commands. They are all having default values and
                are configurable with custom tuning values on global, group or host level.
                List of configurable variables:
                  * cca_splunk_bootstrap_shcluster_captain_retries
                  * cca_splunk_cluster_bundle_status_retries
                  * cca_splunk_finalize_upgrade_retries
                  * cca_splunk_kvstore_backup_status_retries

              - Improved logic to store staging apps during deployment, related to data onboarding.
              - Improved detection filter in rsync to avoid false positives during deployment-apps
                deployment.
              - Refactoring cca.splunk.ssl-certificates tasks to better detect certificate update
                needs.
              - Updated prerequisites running CCA on Manager server
                  * Updated python version to 3.11.3+, install a new venv, update .profile_local
                    with new venv path.

              - Updated the rolling update playbook to handle Linux kernels with no standard
                cgroupv1 support, including latest kernel updates for Fedora and RHEL 9.
              - Added a cca_cgroup_version_daemon to make sure cgroupv1 is available even if host
                has been updated manually without CCA. Run configure_linux_server playbook to
                create and enable it.

              Bug fixes:
                * Corrected splunkd restart and reload deploy-server handler that caused both

                    standard data onboarding and can safely be removed if available in a onboarding
                    repo.
              - Added requirement to have community.crypto module install. Install via
                ansible-galaxy collection install community.crypto

               Bug fixes:
                  * Updated splunk_login.yml task to handle forced splunkd restart. Useful when
                    a config error that prevented splunkd to start has been fixed but splunkd
                    restart has not been triggered.
                  * Corrected onboarding variable names in cca.splunk.onboarding tasks.
                  * Corrected searchhead_deployer_shcluster_c* in templates/infrastructure_template/
                    environments/ENVIRONMENT_NAME/group_vars. Please update your local files with the updates.
                  * Corrected variables in setup_wizard to work with proper ENV variables and limited
                    tmpfs space.
                  * Corrected the wizard that runs via `cca_ctrl --setup` as it didn't generate random
                    password for the c2 to c8 index and search head cluster. Re-run the setup to
                    produce new random pass4SymmKeys.
                  * Updated env variables to not quote stings for paths as it prevented shell expansions.
                  * Fixed scroll text option in cca_ctrl playbook selection.
                  * Added `connection: local` when `delegate_to: localhost` is used on the manager server as that
                    connection is for localhost.
                  * Changed instruction to store splunk binaries for setup_wizard in /var/tmp/
                  * Corrected logic in manage_searchhead_clusters.yml that prevented SH Cluster C2-> to run.
                  * Changed variables to track multiple Search Head Cluster captain init status during
                    cluster bootstrap.
                  * Corrected static repo type reference in cca_ctrl host list function.


    2022.2.4 - CCA is now supporting Rocky Linux 8, automation_readiness_cca_manager.yml is
               updated with the new OS support.
             - Added ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3 variable to hosts file in
               ansible inventory.
             - Updated template hosts file with availability groups that now covers all index
               and search head clusters. Copy template files or update your hosts file manually.
             - Added splunk_volume_path_hot and splunk_volume_path_cold to
               cluster_peers_cluster_c* where they were missing.
             - Initial work to get CCA for Splunk to run on Mac OSX. Setup Wizard can run on
               a Mac. cca.splunk.enterprise-install/tasks/ensure_splunk_version.yml updated
               to work with Linux and Darwin Splunk Enterprise binaries.
             - cca_ctrl is updated to detect Darwin OS and require that 'gsed' is installed.
             - CCA Splunk secrets is now a one-line variable with ansible-vault. Updates can
               now be done, full wizard run is required. Specific updates can be supported.
             - Updated versions where deployment server can be enabled. Splunk has backported
               the fix for svd-2022-0608 to Splunk Enterprise 8.2.6.1 and 8.2.7.
             - Reformatted EXTRA_VARS so they will be presented as a column list instead of
               long string.


             Bug fixes:
                * Changed to linear strategy in configure_linux_servers.yml playbook.
                * Removed splunk start from manage_searchhead_clusters.yml. Caused race
                  condition on a earlier initial startup task. Seen on high performance
                  servers.
                * Updated roles/*/meta/main.yml to correct meta information that was missing.
                * Renamed variable for rolling peer restart retries, new variable is
                  cluster_peer_rolling_restart_preflight_retries.
                * Removed manual prompt of rolling restart verification in
                  cca.core.splunk/tasks/cluster_peers_rolling_restart.yml
                * Added check and wait function so that a Search Head Cluster rolling restart
                  can complete if it's in progress when the playbooks runs.
                  cca.splunk.role-searchhead/tasks/splunk_login.yml updated with extended
                  retry to wait for a Search Head Member to start up, might be in a rolling
                  restart phase.
                * Updated cca.splunk.onboarding/README.md to match directory structure
                  in data onboarding repo.
                * cca_ctrl - fix scroll function to be able to read release notes in the UI.
                * Increased timeout for initial start of Splunk from 120 to 180 seconds to
                  handle lab environments with lower specs.
                * General correction of spelling errors.

    2022.2.3 Set current Splunk Enterprise version so that group_vars files can use it.
             Updated deployment_server group_vars file, if current Splunk Enterprise
             version is below 9.0.0, disable deployment server functionallity.

             Bug fixes:
                * Corrected splunk_conf_group_settings variable in
                  templates/infrastructure_template/environments/ENVIRONMENT_NAME/group_vars/
                  for
                     all_in_one_servers
	             data_collection_nodes
	             deployment_servers
	             forwarders
	             hybrid_searchheads
                  Important: Copy these files to your environments/ENVIRONMENT_NAME/group_vars
                             folder if you have already run the setup. If not, you don't need to
                             do anything.

    2022.2.2 Playbooks to manage Splunk Enterprise upgrades and CVE info
             Splunk Deployment Servers with a versions earlier than 9.0 has
             the following CVE-2022-32158, CVSSv3.1 Score: 9.0, Critical
             https://www.splunk.com/en_us/product-security/announcements/svd-2022-0608.html

             To upgrade just the Splunk Deployment Servers, add an explicit version in the
             hosts inventory file.
             [deployment_servers:vars]
             splunk_enterprise_version='9.0.0'

             Store the tgz file in the infrastructure repo at splunk/var/images.

             Run ./cca_ctrl and select the playbook upgrade_non_clustered_splunk_servers.yml
             and target only the Deployment Servers. Perform the upgrade in a test environment
             before doing so in Production.

             Playbooks added:
                rolling_upgrade_splunk_clusters.yml
                upgrade_non_clustered_splunk_servers.yml

             Bug fixes:
                * Corrected path for splunk in task ensure_splunk_version.yml
                * Removed manifest files from diff cleanup files, manifest files
                  are a great source of information to get insight on the historical
                  upgrade path of an Splunk Server
                * Shorten menu description for configure_linux_servers.yml
