             Store the tgz file in the infrastructure repo at splunk/var/images.

             Run ./cca_ctrl and select the playbook upgrade_non_clustered_splunk_servers.yml
             and target only the Deployment Servers. Perform the upgrade in a test environment
             before doing so in Production.

             Playbooks added:
                rolling_upgrade_splunk_clusters.yml
